# TCC — Terminal Crypto Currency

TCC (Terminal Crypto Currency) is a **web-based crypto market alert platform**.

The goal of TCC is to help users identify potential trading setups based on
their **own custom-defined conditions**.

TCC does **not** place trades and does **not** provide financial advice.
It is designed strictly for **educational and analytical purposes**.

---

## What TCC Does

TCC allows users to:

- Select a cryptocurrency (example: BTC, ETH)
- Choose a timeframe (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, etc.)
- Define custom trading conditions
- Receive alerts when those conditions are met

Instead of giving pre-made signals, TCC lets the **user define their own setup**.

---

## Example Use Case

A user may define a setup such as:

- Alert when RSI goes below 30  
- Alert when price crosses above a moving average  
- Alert when volume increases suddenly  

When the market meets these conditions, TCC sends an alert to the user.

---

## Core Idea

Most trading tools tell users *what to trade*.

TCC focuses on:

- User logic
- Personal strategies
- Market awareness
- Learning how setups behave

The system simply watches the market and notifies the user when their
rules are triggered.

---

## What TCC Will NOT Do

- ❌ No automatic trading
- ❌ No buying or selling assets
- ❌ No guarantees of profit
- ❌ No financial advice

TCC is a monitoring and alert system only.

---

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of TCC is to:

- Help users study market behavior
- Practice technical analysis
- Build discipline around trading setups
- Learn how markets react to conditions

TCC is intended as a **learning and analysis tool**, not a trading bot.

---

## Long-Term Vision

In the future, TCC may support:

- Multiple indicators
- Advanced strategy logic
- Strategy history tracking
- Visual dashboards
- Community strategy sharing

All while remaining alert-based only.

---

## Summary

TCC is a customizable crypto alert platform that allows users to define
their own trading setups and receive notifications when market conditions
match their rules.

Simple idea.  
Powerful flexibility.  
User-controlled logic.
